<h1>Quantitative Risk Assessment program - University of Essex</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This code reads the asset values and threat levels from two text files (asset_values.txt and threat_levels.txt) that contain comma-separated values for each asset and threat. It then defines two functions (calculate_ale and interpret_ale) that work as in the previous example. Finally, it uses the read asset values and threat levels to calculate the annualized loss expectancy for a given asset and threat, and interprets the result based on the same scoring system as before.
